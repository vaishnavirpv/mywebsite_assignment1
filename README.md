This is the FED assignment website. 
Audience of this website come in to look at cream story, look for now updates and offers.
Audience may also come in if theya re interested in taking up a franchise(this part is fictional)
I personally like this store that is why I took up this. 
Most post are taken from their own instagram and facebook page. 
I have tried to closely follow my wireframe. 3/4 of my work will be similar to that. 
The navigation bar is sticky so that users can easily navigate to where they want to go.
I have also added a to top button in the form of a butterfly. to make it easy to move up.
I have tried to make the website as legitamate as possible with addind real texts. 
All the external links like instagram, facebook etc will open on a new tab. the nav bar opens on the ]
same page.
I got a lot on inspiration from 3 different websites.
Cafe Olimpico | Authentic Italian Café in the Heart of Montréal – Café Olimpico (cafe-olimpico-1970.myshopify.com)
Cafe In Borehamwood | Cacao Bean Restaurant And Cafe
Sunny Street Café | Breakfast, Lunch and Catering Restaurant (sunnystreetcafe.com)
